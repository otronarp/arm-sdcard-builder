* Raspberry Pi Linux Tar SD Card Generator
** Why
Installing Linux from tar archives is cumbersome. 
Then also OSX does not support EXT filesystems. For that on OSX to flash an SD card for ArchLinuxARM, Alpine etc. a VM has to be started.
To make things easier the Docker image does exactly that. Makes it easy, fast and reproducible to generate and flash image to sd card on Mac and Linux.
** How
`docker run --privileged --device=/dev/diskX:/dev/sdb -v .:/tmp/img --rm peelsky/rpi-tar-to-img`
