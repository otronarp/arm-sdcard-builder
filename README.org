* Raspberry Pi Linux Tar SD Card Generator
** Why
OSX does not support EXT filesystems. To flash an SD card for ArchLinuxARM, Alpine etc. a VM has to be started.
To make things easier the image does exactly that. 
** How
Put an SD card in your MacBook's SD card reader
*IMPORTANT! Make sure you select the right disk id from =df -h= otherwise your day's about to get bad, sad & ugly*
In =playbook.yml= make sure to reflect your disk config from =df -h=.
In =playbook.yml= set distro download url and download filename.
When running with =vagrant up= (or =vagrant provision=) you will be asked for a *LOCAL* (MacBook) root password
** Perks
At times OSX might randomly mount back the SD card after mounting into the VM. Make sure to unmount it and rerun provisioning.
